 User story: 
'As a young entrepeneur I want more information about setting up a company, to set up more of a succes'

This is the user story I worked with. The concept I made is a road map of the big steps of starting a company.
Like making the concept or thinking about marketing. This gives the user a bit more of a guideline on where to start searching. 
In each headlines are sub buttons with some subjects that are included in the main subject. 
If you click on those buttons, you will find books, audio books etc. that match the buttons description.
